Use this to adapt your program above to a function that computes and plots our analytical solutions *(use different functions for computing and plotting)*. This program should take an initial velocity and the angle $\\theta$ that the ball was hit with in degrees. It should also produce a 3D graph of the motion. You need also to find the maximum values for $x,y,$ and $z$."
