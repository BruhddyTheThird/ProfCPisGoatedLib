    "\n",
    "Science is a collective endeavor. Historically however, much of scientific knowledge has been represented as the work of individuals. Moreover, access to scientific knowledge has often been restricted to privileged groups through paywalls, expensive textbooks, and exclusive institutions. This has led to significant barriers for many people who wish to engage with and contribute to scientific knowledge.\n",

    "[Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) is a movement that aims to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of society.
